AQ-informed palette quantizer — perceptual masking meets color quantization.

## License

Sustainable, large-scale open source work requires a funding model, and I have been
doing this full-time for 15 years. If you are using this for closed-source development
AND make over $1 million per year, you'll need to buy a commercial license at
https://www.imazen.io/pricing

Commercial licenses are similar to the Apache 2 license but company-specific, and on
a sliding scale. You can also use this under the AGPL v3.
